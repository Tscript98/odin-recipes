    <h2>A delicious meat lasagna perfect for the whole family</h2>
        <p>This lasagna recipe is a hearty, customizable classic made with sweet Italian sausage, lean ground beef, onion, garlic, and a rich tomato-based sauce enhanced with sugar and spices like basil, fennel, and Italian seasoning. It’s layered with cooked lasagna noodles, a creamy ricotta mixture bound with egg, mozzarella slices, and Parmesan cheese. The dish is baked at 375°F for about 50 minutes—covered for the first half, uncovered for the second—and should rest for 15 minutes before serving to set properly.</p>
